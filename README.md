# SNUG Node.js Examples [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/snug-lab/node-examples/issues)

### The Goal:

Create a base of examples showing how easy it is to get started with Node.js. We are always in progress.

### The Projects:

* [hapi-basic-api](https://github.com/snug-lab/snug-node-examples/tree/master/hapi-basic-api)
* [express-node-sass](https://github.com/snug-lab/snug-node-examples/tree/master/express-node-sass)
* [express-knex-angular](https://github.com/snug-lab/snug-node-examples/tree/master/express-knex-angular)

### Usage:

Just clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/snug-lab/snug-node-examples.git
```

If you don't have Node.js yet:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.16.1/install.sh | sh

$ nvm install stable

$ nvm use stable
```

In each example directory, run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start the server by running the command:

```bash
$ npm start
```
